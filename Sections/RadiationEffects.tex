\section{Overview of radiation effects on detector systems}
\label{sec:effects}
{\it Editors: M.~Moll, I.~Dawson, A.~Nother?}  \\

\noindent
A general introduction/overview on effects of radiation -- we could possibly merge this section into the other sections, but my view is it's better to separate the theory from the measurements as much as possible? We could also briefly describe in this section how radiation challenges in our field differ to other industries?

\subsection{Sensors}
Leakage currents, depletion voltage, CCE, etc.

\subsection{Electronics}
SEUs etc.

\subsection{Optoelectronics}
Section on relevant opto/photonic (fibres, LEDs and lasers, etc.)

\subsection{Services}
Anything to say here apart from scattering and activation?
